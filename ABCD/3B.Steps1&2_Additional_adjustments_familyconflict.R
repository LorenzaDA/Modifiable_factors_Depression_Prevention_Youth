# 3B. Sensitivity analyses with adjustments for family conflict

# PROJECT: Modifiable factors internalizing problems in youth from general population and at risk 
# license CC 4.0 International
# DATA: ABCD (release 4.0, from download data manager)
# AIM OF SCRIPT: are results similar when we additionally adjust for the potential confounding effect of 
# family conflict on the relationship between modifiable factors and internalizing problems?
