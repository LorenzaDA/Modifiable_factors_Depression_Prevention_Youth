# set covariates
# NB site and ethn were previously residualized for, to be able to loop across the different prevention scenario
# that is because the high genetic liability group is restricted to individuals of genetically European ancestry
# meaning that the loop would fail if ethn was included 
# this is similarly for site. the different datasets have different individuals
# so some sites which are present in the universal prevention setting, are not 
# in the other prevention setting. This limits our ability to loop across the various prevention settings (datasets)
# for these reasons, we residualized for ethn and site. Notably, results were tested also when adjustments (instead of residualization)
# were performed and they were equivalent
