**ABOUT THIS WORK**
**Aim of this project:** Investigating how potential interventions on modifiable factors could reduce depression risk (internalizing symptoms) in the general population and in at-risk groups. 

**Main predictors:** Modifiable factors that have been consistently found to reduce depression risk: Physical activity, screen time, sleep duration, social support. These were measured in childhood.

**Potential interventions:** These potential/hypothetical interventions consist on setting modifiable factors to be of different values than they currently are (e.g., setting every child to do 3 hours of physical activity a day instead of 2 hours). This will then inform on the predicted internalizing problems under such changes in the modifiable factor. 

**Outcome:** Internalizing problems, a key precursor of depression later in life. These were measured in adolescence. 

**Samples:** Two independent population-based samples, based in the US and the Netherlands, respectively: The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD, https://abcdstudy.org/) and The Generation R (GenR, https://generationr.nl/) Studies. 
We considered different prevention strategies for each of these samples, to concurrently test how intervening on modifiable factors could reduce depression risk if we were to implement interventions in everyone vs. just at-risk groups. In the prevention literature, this is generally done by using universal (intervention on everyone), selective (intervention on those with risk factors for the disorder), or indicated (intervention on those with subclinical levels of the disorder) prevention approaches. 

For both the ABCD and GenR studies we thus reconstructed the samples as follows:
1. For universal prevention, the full sample was utilized
2. For selective prevention, a subset with a) high genetic liability for depression or b) high exposure to stressful life events was selected. NB only few participants had both a and b
3. For indicated prevention, a subset with subclinical levels of internalizing problems in childhood was selected

**Design and analytical approaches:** Target trial emulation and g-formula, with relevant sensitivity analyses (e.g., natural course scenario). These are causal approaches which can be used with observational data to strengthen confidence in the results when research questions have an explanatory aim.
